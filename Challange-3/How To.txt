Challenge #3

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

1 - Open the python script - nested_object_key.py
2 - I have created the function and where need to pass the object & Key. It will return the value.
3 - I used dictionary concpet in Python to crack this Challenge.
