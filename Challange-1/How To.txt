Challenge #1

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity to create these resources on a cloud environment (Azure/AWS/GCP). Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

1 - A 3-tier environment consists of  Web/App server and  SQL server.
The architecture diagram shows how the application will be accessible via URL. There is an application load balancer behind the Website. Route 53 will help to resolve this. I did not use Route 53 and accessed the ALB via public as I have allowed over the internet.
3- The target group will contain the application server behind the application load balancer.
4 - In the VPC, I created two Public and Private subnets in different Availability Zones.
5 - A highly available application has been created with two applications and two SQL servers in different Availability Zones.
7 - Terraform has been used to build the infrastructure. HashiCorp Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool that allows DevOps engineers to programmatically provision the physical resources an application requires to run. Infrastructure as code is an IT practice that manages an application's underlying IT infrastructure through programming.
8 - I have attached the screenshots in a word document where all AWS infrastructure screenshots are captured after creating via Terraform.
9 - I have kept my Terraform code as well where all code is mentioned.
